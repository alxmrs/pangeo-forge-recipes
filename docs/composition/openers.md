# Openers

Once you've created a {doc}`file pattern <file_patterns>` for your source data,
you'll need to open it somehow. Pangeo Forge currently provides the following openers:

- {class}`pangeo_forge_recipes.transforms.OpenURLWithFSSpec`
- {class}`pangeo_forge_recipes.transforms.OpenWithXarray`
- {class}`pangeo_forge_recipes.transforms.OpenWithKerchunk`
